### Project: SociaLite

**SociaLite** is a desktop app for **connecting avid social media users with their contactsâ€™ social media pages**, optimized for use via a command line interface (CLI). At the same time, it has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Feature**: Command history (PR [\#52](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/52), [\#130](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/130))

  
  * What it does:
  

  	* Allows users to browse through commands that they have entered by pressing `UP/DOWN` key in the command box.
  	* Resembles the behavior of macOS or Windows terminal.
  
  * Justification:

  	* Previously, if a user made a careless typo in the command, he/she would have to re-type the entire command, which can be very frustrating and time-consuming.
  
  	* With command history, users can simply press the `UP` key, make slight edit to the previous command and hit `Enter` again.
  
  	* This feature improves the UX significantly because a user can now rectify his/her typo in an efficient way.
  
  
  * Highlights:
  
  	* Command history of the current session, as well as all previous sessions, are stored in a `.json` file. This requires good grasp of json serialisation.
  
  	* The design of this feature involves thorough understanding of the `Storage` component, and multiple new classes are created.
  

* **New Feature**: Pin/Unpin contact card (PR [\#81](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/81), [\#142](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/142))

  * What it does:
  	* Allows users to pin/unpin specified contact cards to the top of the list, similar to Telegram.
  	* Users can either type `pin/unpin INDEX` in the command box, or press the `Pin/Unpin` button on the top-right hand corner of the contact card.

  * Justification:
  	* Users might want to keep a few of their closest friends/family members at the top of their contact list for easy reference.

  
  * Highlights:
  
  	* The design of this feature involves thorough understanding of `ContactList`, `UniquePersonList`.
  
  	* This feature provides support for both CLI and GUI.
  

* **New Feature**: Share contact (PR [\#71](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/71), [\#140](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/140))

  * What it does:
  
  	* Allows users to copy contact information of a selected contact card (e.g. name, phone number, social media handles) to the system clipboard.
  	* Users can either type `share INDEX` in the command box, or press the `Share` button on the top-right hand corner of the contact card.
  
  * Justification:
  
  	* The main idea of SociaLite is individualized online interaction. This new feature aligns with the product concept.
  
  	* By attaching a URL to the product site, contact sharing will introduce more users to try SociaLite in the future.
  
  
  * Highlights:
  	* This feature provides support for both CLI and GUI.
  

* **New Feature**: Telegram handle support (PR [\#31](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/31))

  * What it does:
  	* Allows users to add/edit a contact's Telegram handle using the `tele/` prefix.

  * Justification:
  	* CRUD of social media handles is an integral feature of SociaLite.

  
  * Highlights:
  	* Being the first PR of the kind, the implementation of this feature provides a scalable framework for teammates regarding the storing of other social media handles (PR [\#35](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/35), [\#36](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/36), [\#37](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/37)).
  

* **Altered Feature**: Optional remark (PR [\#56](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/56))

  * What it does:
  	* Allows users to create/update a contact without remark.

  * Justification:
  	* With Zac's implementation of making social media handles optional (PR [\#42](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/42)), it only makes sense to make remark optional as well.

  
  * Highlights:
  	* Being the first PR of the kind, the implementation of this feature provides a scalable framework for teammates regarding the storing of other social media handles (PR [\#35](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/35), [\#36](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/36), [\#37](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/37)).
