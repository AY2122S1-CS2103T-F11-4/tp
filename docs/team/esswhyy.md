###Project: SociaLite

SociaLite is a desktop app designed to better connect social media users with their contacts. 
It is a Java based Command Line Interface (CLI) program with added JavaFX UI.

Below is a summary of my contributions:

**New Features**
- Added the ability to add short Remarks to each contact, with a 150-character limit

Impact: Allows users to better identify their contacts when storing them.

- Added the ability to find contacts via names, tags and/or social platforms.
  
Impact: Allows the user to effectively and efficiently manage a large network of contacts.

Most of my feature contributions were for the Find Command, this is because there are many sub-functionalities for Find,
for example, needing to properly implement partial matching for names and tags, and ensuring improper social media 
platforms are handled.


**Improved Features**
- Improved test coverage of SociaLite's codebase overall by 10+%, mainly for various classes under `logic` and `ui`.

- Improved CSS and appearance of SociaLite's UI from the base address book UI.
