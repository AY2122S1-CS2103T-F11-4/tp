### Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic): Parses and executes the appropriate command according to the user's input.
* [**`Model`**](#model): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component <a name="ui"></a>

The `UI` component interacts with other components of SociaLite, and uses the JavaFX UI framework to render a GUI.

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/ui/Ui.java).

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, including `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All the parts, as well as the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.  The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

The `PersonCard` part also has a reference to the `MainWindow` to provide improved user feedback via the main window after user interactions which do not execute a command using `Logic`.

### Logic component <a name="logic"></a>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SocialiteParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SocialiteParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SocialiteParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component <a name="model"></a>
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="750" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the contact list data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in SociaLite, which `Person` references. This allows SociaLite to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

</div>


### Storage component <a name="storage"></a>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="950" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save contact list data, user preference data and command history data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `ContactListStorage`, `UserPrefsStorage`, `CommandHistoryStorage` and `ProfilePictureStorage` which means it can be treated as any one (if the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes <a name="common"></a>

Classes used by multiple components are in the `socialite.commons` package. These include:

* [`core`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/socialite/commons/core): General classes which deal with storage of SociaLite configuration and GUI settings, logging and commonly used messages. The [`Index`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/socialite/commons/core/index/Index.java) class is also used widely to manage references to specific items in the contact list.
* [`exceptions`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/socialite/commons/exceptions): Common exceptions used throughout SociaLite.
* [`util`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/socialite/commons/util): Utility methods pertaining to collections, files, JSON, strings, etc.

## **Implementation** <a name="implementation"></a>

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Help Command <a name="help_command"></a>

In order to simplify the error messages displayed via the GUI whenever a user enters an invalid command or non-conforming command format, 
the display of in-app guidance and help messages has been abstracted away from the specific command. As a result, the existing `HelpCommand` was 
revamped and expanded to display in-app guidance, consisting of the following details for a specified command:
* Overview of specified command's function
* Acceptable format of user input
* Example of using the specified command

Represented below is the sequence diagram when `help XYZ` is executed. For illustration purposes, `XYZ` refers to an acceptable command in SociaLite that has in-app guidance for users' reference.

![HelpSequenceDiagram](images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png)

For the correct `HelpCommand` to be created and appropriate in-app guidance to be displayed, a `HelpCommandParser` was created to parse additional keywords provided by the user. 
The acceptable keywords are: `add` `delete` `edit` `find` `picture` `pin` `unpin` `remark` and `share`.

Should an invalid keyword accompany `help`, the `HelpCommandParser` will create a generic `HelpCommand` that displays the HelpWindow dialog box. 
The HelpWindow dialog box provides users with the link to our User Guide and the list of acceptable keywords (as listed above) to view in-app guidance.


### Find Command <a name="find_command"></a>


### Picture Command <a name="picture_command"></a>

The Picture command allows users to add a profile picture to their contacts. The user can enter the command `picture INDEX` which would open a file browser to let the user choose any .jpg or .png file to be used as the profile picture, provided `INDEX` is a valid index

Represented below is the sequence diagram when `picture INDEX` is executed. For illustration purposes, `INDEX` refers to any valid index starting from 1 to the number of contacts in the displayed list.

![PictureSequenceDiagram](images/PictureSequenceDiagram.png)

Note that the picture command depends on the MainWindow in the UI package as it retrieves the file from a file chooser.

## **Appendix: Requirements** <a name="requirements"></a>

### Product scope <a name="scope"></a>

**Target user profile**:

* avid social media user
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* needs to manage a significant number of contacts
* wants to catch up with their contactsâ€™ activities quickly 
* wants to connect with their followers/friends on various social media platforms through an all-in-one dashboard

**Value proposition**: 

Our product serves as an integrated dashboard for a user to retrieve the social media activities and account information of his/her contacts. This makes it seamless for the user to interact with his/her contacts instead of having to access each social media account that the contact owns.
